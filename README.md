# Smart Dashboard Forex Software

This code is an example of a Smart Dashboard Forex Software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The Smart Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for manual trade review and allows the user to perform various actions on their trading orders, such as closing all orders, closing sell orders, and closing buy orders. It also includes a Forex analysis function for performing fast and accurate analysis of the market.

## Declarations

- `symbol`: A string variable used to store the current symbol.
- `lotSize`: A double variable used to store the default lot size.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the program. It sets the default lot size and retrieves the current symbol.

## User-friendly Interface

The `UserInterface()` function displays the Smart Dashboard with buttons for manual trade review. It provides options for closing all orders, closing all sell orders, and closing all buy orders.

## Close Orders

The `CloseAllOrders()` function closes all open orders by looping through all orders and closing them individually.
